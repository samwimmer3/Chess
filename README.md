# ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess ‚Äî Real-Time Multiplayer Web App

## üß† Project Vision
This project is a full-stack real-time multiplayer chess game built from scratch using modern web technologies. The goal is to simulate a real development experience and deepen skills in TypeScript, WebSockets, full-stack architecture, and OOP.

The project is built in a monorepo and emphasizes real-world software engineering workflows (PRs, GitHub Projects, code reviews, etc.).
